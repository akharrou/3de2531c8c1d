## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a deep blue (#1A237E) to convey trust and professionalism, rather than the black color of the sample, as deep blues are more appropriate to medical fields.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the content. Dark scheme avoided to enhance readability.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) as an accent to add a touch of vibrancy, for highlighting interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' for headlines (serif), 'PT Sans' for body (sans-serif) to create a balance of elegance and readability.
- Employ a consistent spacing system (e.g., 8px grid) for padding, margins, and component spacing to maintain visual harmony.
- Utilize modern, clean icons from Lucide React, ensuring each icon aligns with the service or information it represents.
- Implement subtle fade-in and hover animations to add a layer of interactivity without overwhelming the user.
